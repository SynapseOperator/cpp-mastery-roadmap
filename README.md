# 🚀 C++ Mastery Roadmap

A structured roadmap documenting my journey to mastering **C++** — from fundamentals and OOP to data structures, STL, and algorithms.

This repository serves as both a personal growth log and a long-term learning archive.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Build a solid foundation in C++ syntax and memory management  
- Understand object-oriented programming (OOP) and design principles  
- Implement classic data structures and algorithms  
- Practice clean code and engineering habits  
- Develop small but meaningful C++ projects
